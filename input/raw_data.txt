Globex Energy 2024 Sustainability Report

Our commitment to reducing emissions is core to our strategy. To mitigate methane slippage, our Permian Basin facility implemented a new flare gas recovery unit in Q3 2024. This initiative has successfully reduced routine flaring volume by 35% compared to our 2023 baseline, a result verified by our internal audit team.

We terminated our contract with one transportation supplier this year after our annual audit identified repeated violations of our anti-corruption policies, specifically regarding facilitation payments at port authorities.

Globex Energy has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination. In 2024, four incidents of discrimination were reported through our internal Ethics Hotline, all of which have been reviewed and have remediation plans currently being implemented.

We have operations in both conflict-affected and stable regions. Our security personnel in all regions, including the 50 officers stationed in our high-risk operations in Region X, have completed mandatory human rights training based on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. This covers 100% of our security team
